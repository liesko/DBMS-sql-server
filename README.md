# DBMS-sql-server
Database Management System for SQL Server 2014

# Connect to your database
The software first asks for some credentials: IP address, port, your user name and password. Then you can connect to the database and see what's inside.

# Discover
The application displays all your databases (including system databases such as master, model, msdb and tempdb). You can select which one you would like to discover. You will see all your tables and columns.

# Filter
Sometimes there is too much data in tables - so why not select only those columns you need to see? You can select particular columns and the right data will be shown in a table.

# Sort and order
Do you need ordered data? No problem, this program implements a component similar to excel tables - just one click on a cell and the data in the table will re-render in appropriate manner.
